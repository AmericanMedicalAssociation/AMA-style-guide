# This script wraps drush. It allows you to transparently use a project-local
# drush and drushrc.php, if they are available, but falls back to the system
# drush.
#
# To use it, add a line like this to your ~/.profile:
# alias drush=/var/www/PROJECT_NAME.local/bin/drush
#
# Then, try `drush status` from your home directory, and again from the project
# root.
