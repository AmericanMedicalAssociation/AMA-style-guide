A Landscape Image Card is a card that contains an image, a title and description in a semi-opaque overlay, and a block level link.

The image used should be of a 3:2 aspect ratio with a minimum of 600px in width (1200px retina). Except for large mobile layouts, the card size will never exceed 600px in width.
