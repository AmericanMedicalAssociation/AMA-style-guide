title: Article Preview
---

An Article Preview molecule contains a topic label (optional), an article title, a description, and optionally either an image or a Youtube embed. Variants are defined based on what fields are needed in each variant, i.e. image or video. The order of elements is determined using flexbox where different from the base pattern.

"Article Preview Video" is the variant of this pattern that includes a video rather than an image.
