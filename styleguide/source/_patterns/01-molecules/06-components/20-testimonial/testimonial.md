A Testimonial 50/50 consists of two evenly divided columns. One column contains an Image. The other contains a Quote (long text), a Speaker (text), and a Speaker Title (text). 

There are two variants, a left and a right variant. In this variant, the image displays in the right column. There is also a Testimonial 50/50 Left pattern, which places the image in the left column instead.
