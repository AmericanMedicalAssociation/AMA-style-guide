title: "Two Up Wrap Layout"
---
The Two Up Wrap Layout displays items in two equal side-by-side columns. For use when you have sibling elements that need to be in wrapped in columns but don't have the luxury of creating parent wrapper containers. 

Uses flexbox and some transparent border trickery to create the visual effect of having a gutter between the two columns.
