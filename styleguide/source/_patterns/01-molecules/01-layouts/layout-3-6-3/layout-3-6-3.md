A "3/6/3 Layout" is a layout that includes a three-column column, a six-column column, and a three-column column.

The inline styling `style="background: palevioletred"` is not necessary for actual implementation and should be removed.

See *Templates > Topic > Topic* for an example of this layout being implemented.
