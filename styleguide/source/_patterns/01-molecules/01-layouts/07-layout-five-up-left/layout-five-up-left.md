The Five Up Left Layout displays five items, one large primary item in the left column and two secondary columns of two items on the right.

Can be implemented by adding `.layout-five-up-left` class to a container, `.layout_five-up-left-primary` and `.layout_five-up-left-secondary` classes to the right and left two containers respectively, and `.layout_five-up-left-item` class to individual content blocks.
