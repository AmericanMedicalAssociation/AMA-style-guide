DEPRECATED | The One Up Layout displays items in a single column, centered on the page, 8 columns wide.

Note: The layout-example_placeholder class is for demonstrating the layout in the style guide and should not be used in production.

This layout will be refactored in [https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3878](https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3878)
