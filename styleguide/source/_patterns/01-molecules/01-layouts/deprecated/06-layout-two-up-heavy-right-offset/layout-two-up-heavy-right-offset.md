DEPRECATED | The Two Up Heavy Right Offset Layout displays items in two side-by-side columns, with the primary side, on the right, being wider than the secondary side. Both columns are offset to align left.

Note: The layout-example_placeholder class is for demonstrating the layout in the style guide and should not be used in production.

This layout will be refactored in [https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3877](https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3877)
