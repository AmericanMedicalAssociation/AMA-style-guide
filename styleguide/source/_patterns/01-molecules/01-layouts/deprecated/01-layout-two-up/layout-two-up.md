DEPRECATED | The Two Up Layout displays items in two equal side-by-side columns.

Note: The layout-example_placeholder class is for demonstrating the layout in the style guide and should not be used in production.

This layout will be refactored in [https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3881](https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3881)
