DEPRECATED | The One Up Layout displays items in a single column.

Note: The layout-example_placeholder class is for demonstrating the layout in the style guide and should not be used in production.

This layout will be refactored in [https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3874](https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3874)
