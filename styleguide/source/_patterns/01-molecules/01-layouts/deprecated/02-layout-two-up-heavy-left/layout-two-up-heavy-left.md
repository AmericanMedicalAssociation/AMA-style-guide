DEPRECATED | The Two Up Heavy Left Layout displays items in two side-by-side columns, with the primary side being wider than the secondary.

Note: The layout-example_placeholder class is for demonstrating the layout in the style guide and should not be used in production.

This layout will be refactored in [https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3873](https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3873)
