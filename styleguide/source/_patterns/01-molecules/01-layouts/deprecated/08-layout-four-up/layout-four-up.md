DEPRECATED | The Four Up Layout displays four items side-by-side. It wraps to two items per row at tablet size and one item per row for mobile.

Note: The layout-example_placeholder class is for demonstrating the layout in the style guide and should not be used in production.

This layout will be refactored in [https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3871](https://issues.ama-assn.org/browse/EWL-3871)
