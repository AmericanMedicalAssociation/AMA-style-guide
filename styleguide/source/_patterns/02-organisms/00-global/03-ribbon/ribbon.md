The ecosystem ribbon is a nav dom element with class .ribbon that exists at the top of the body on all AMA corporate and wire AMA pages. This element is not sticky.

Note: as of 8/14/17, the .scss file for this pattern shows styling for a `.ribbon-uses-new-grid` class. This is used only on Topic pages and should go away once we're allowed to refactor the ribbon globally.
