  <h3>Structure</h3>
  <p>This living style guide is built with <a href="http://patternlab.io/" class="link " target="_blank">Pattern Lab</a> and adheres to the principles of <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" class="link " target="_blank">Atomic Design</a>.</p>

  <h3>Contributions</h3>
  <p>For any code that you would like to contribute to the style guide, first create an issue in Github explaining clearly what problem you are trying to solve.</p>
  <p>Make sure you have adhered to the guidelines outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/AmericanMedicalAssociation/AMA-style-guide/blob/develop/styleguide/docs/code_conventions.md" class="link " target="_self">Code Conventions documentation</a> before submitting a pull request. Reference the Github issue you created when you submit your pull request.</p>
  <h3>Annotation and Documentation</h3>
  <p>Each pattern should have its own accompanying <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" class="link " target="_blank">Markdown</a> file that contains 1) a useful description of the pattern and 2) links to the relevant Jira tickets/Github issues relating to that pattern's creation. This information is needed to provide context as to how and when  a particular pattern should be used.</p>
